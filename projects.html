        <h2 class="title">Checkers Algorithm</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Now I know I said I am very much interested in chess, buts checkers isn't too far off. It's got pieces, a board, and strategy.
            This project was the first one I have ever worked on, which means it was a hard one aswell. To be honest, looking back it was
            not too hard, we just had to make one function, everything else was done for us. We had to work on the strategy algorithm function. This 
            function is supposed to determine the best next move for the player. At first we had trouble coming up with a consistent strategy, but
            we eventually landed on one that awards points based on good moves. Better moves means higher points. Making it go for higher ponints
            would make it choose the best moves. We also had to consider when to not choose the best move. For example if promoting a piece to king
            would give me 5 points but if that gives my opponent a better position, it would be better to wait on that promotion. We competed with others
            who had the same task and ended with second place with our strategy. Overall it was a fun introductory experience to programming
            and left me with desire to learn more.

        <h2 class="title">Praking Lot Directory</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
           For this project we had to design a parking lot web app that keeps track of those who have registered and reserved parking spots.
           This one was fun at first mainly because of the PostgreSQL database language we used to make the different directories. Learning 
           the relational algebra for SQL was tough but I enjoyed every moment of it. It allows us to theorize the queries we had to make
           in PostgreSQL. As we got to making the web application it got annoying to make everything link and work together. Despite that, this
           helped me learn and understand database management and the overall security practices of a Database Administrator.
