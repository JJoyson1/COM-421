        <p class="paragraph">
            Hi there, my name is Jobin and I'm a third year computer science major at Illinois Institute of Technology. I have not always been
            into computers, until starting college that is. My knowledge of these magical devices was just from a user prespective. Throuhghout 
            my educational experience, I gradually became more familiar with how it works behind the screen. I am still quite fresh in this field,
            however I am confident in my current experience and skills to take on challenges thrown down my path. If it turns out to be more than
            I can handle, the worst that would happen is I'd have to learn something new! 
        </p>

        <h2 class="title">What I like to do</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            As I mentioned earlier, I really did not have much experience dealing with computer programming back in the day so most of my hobbies
            reflect that lack of computer involvment. I love playing sports, especially the ones I am bad at. But more than physical challenges, I
            like to make my brain work and thus my interest in strategy based games. The specific one I am very much invested in is chess. There is
            just something about that game that, regardless of whether you win or lose, makes you want to play again and again, trying new strategies.
